## Troubleshoot

- The booking table doesn't have navigation. Remind the LLM to add the new page to the app.
- Error `Composition in draft-enabled entity can't lead to another entity with "@odata.draft.enabled" (in entity:"TravelService.Travel"/element:"Bookings")`. Copy and paste the above error message, and Copilot will fix the issue.
- Section **Booking Extras** is missing in the booking object page. Execute the prompt: `booking extras table section is missing`.
- The Booking Extras table has no data. Execute the prompt: `add mock data for booking extras`.

## Summary
